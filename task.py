    a. Use the original DataFrame and transform its index into a MultiIndex with three levels:

    b. Allocate the different subjects into groups based on two parameters: 
    Their gender, and whether their age is above or below 40. Hint - use `df.groupby`. The result should be similar to what is shown in the figure below (you don't have to plot it yourself).
